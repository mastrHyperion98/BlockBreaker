# Description
Block Breaker is a 2D game in development using the Unity Engine and the Universal Render Pipeline.
This repository will not contain any of the engine tools assets. Only the Unity scenes, materials, prefabs and scripts.

# Game Objective
The objective of the game is to destroy all the blocks in a level without losing control of the ball. The game is meant for educational purposes only and to demonstrate my abilities/familiarity with the Unity Engine and C#. Consequently, do not expect the game's final release to feel ultra polished aesthetically. I am not an artist, but more of a gameplay programmer. 

# Releases

All releases will be posted on the GitHub Repository and will include executables for Windows, Mac and Linux. All beta and alpha versions of the software will be labelled as such. 

# Gameplay Mechanics
* Player launches a ball
* Ball collides and bounces off the gameplay area boundaries and other blocks.
* When ball collides with block it is damaged and eventually destroyed. 
* Some blocks hide special abilities that can help the player.
* Players are awarded a score based on their performance.
